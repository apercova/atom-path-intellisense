/*
There is an issue related with the way this plugin works.
As path recognition is made in a more general way, lines containing multiples
paths crash as the very general path recognition rule for  for this plugin is
forward-slash (/) or relative pseudo paths (./) ord (../).
e.g. Consider following line:
  <a href="/lib/main.js">Main.js</a>&nbsp;<a href="/lib/other.js">Other.js</a>

In above line only first path /lib/main.js gets suggestions.
More precise plugins are needed for accomplish stuff like explained above.
